# Hi!!ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to My Github Profile

### My Name is Utkarsh Luthra and I am a CS student here to contribute, learn, and showcase my projects, (atleast some of them), along with becoming a part of this amazing community of programmers.

## My Journey as a Programmer
My Programming journey personally began in the year 2016, when I started learning HTML (which is not exactly a programming language) cause it eventually led me to learning CSS (again not a programming language) and then JavaScript (here we are). I learned and created several personal projects with JavaScript. 

In 2017, I decided to learn more in programming. I started learning Python in 2017 and it is in that time that I personally started understanding the dynamics of the web and what actualy programming meant to me. I learnt, the basics of python, OOPS, file handling, frameworks like Django and Flask, Pandas. 

In 2018, I worked on multiple python languages but on the same time also learned C++ as another language that I wanted to learn to understand more fundamental ideas of programming and solve multiple computational problems with a new approach. C++, personally, made me understand so many concepts and gave me a new perspective towards programming especially in terms of memory allocation, pointers, etc.

In 2019, I started learning Java for Android Development. It was to keen interest to me to understand how the applications which we use in our everyday life are build and wanted a first hand experience to in. By the December of 2019, I hacd created two Java Projects that I would soon be uploading here on GitHub and putting up on the Play Store.

2020 has been quite a year in my journey towards learning more about computers. I personally kept working on the existing skills I had while learning some soft skills like communication, Git and GitHub etc. which I believe if I knew earlier would have been much more profitable. I have also learnt things like Graphic Designing using Inkscape, Video Editing using ShotCut, and UI/UX Designing using Adobe XD. I also have started tutoring students who want to learn coding for free to the best level I can.
