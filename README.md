# Welcome to My Github Profile

### My Name is Utkarsh Luthra and I am a CS student here to contribute, learn, and showcase my projects, along with becoming a part of this amazing community of programmers.

## My Programming Journey (_2016-2021_)

Started coding in the 2016 while trying to figure out how websites workd. Started with HTML, CSS, and later moved towards JavaScript. Created several projects using the trio of Web Development and then moved on to learning Dynamic Programming for which I started to learn Python and later, Django, along with the basics of Database Management. Further, I also studied the various Data Structures and Algorithms in Programming an I have been doing that ever since.

In 2020, I started learning C++, Java and then further, I worked on several thing related to Android, .Net, ReactJS, etc. The reaso I learned C++ was to have understand the memory allocation and have a better understanding of Object Oriented Programming. While I learned Java to enhance my knowledge of the various programming languages and Android Development in specific.

Back in 2019, I also learned Blender and will be uploading the projects created using that here as well along with a proper step-by-step markdown to help the beginners in the community. Further, in the same year, I learned Adobe XD, Photoshop, Illustrator and have been using these tools for several design projects.

It was in December 2020 that I was introduced to Competitive Programming and have started recently and hope to learn a lot in this domain too.
